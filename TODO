Profile the whole thing
Implement Akil's shape function thing
Characteristic BCs in Maxwell
PML
Periodic BCs in Hedge.

Diagnose pusher with KV distribution.
Add KV-distributed charges slowly to reach steadystate distribution.
Add KV initial condition backed by Poisson solve.

Shape function (l-(r/l)**2)**alpha
element too small->split particles?
divergence cleaning? 

"Smooth particle hydrodynamics" (Ala et al?) (SPH methods)
